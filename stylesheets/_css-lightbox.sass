// CSS-only Lightboxes
// Plugin by Eric Meyer - http://www.oddbird.net/
// Based on the work of Jenna Smith - http://growldesign.co.uk/

// Compatible with IE6+, Mozilla and Webkit browsers.
// **Not compatible with Opera without Javascript help**
//  - You can make it half-work in Opera with one change:
//    - #{!lightboxes} needs an "overflow" of "auto" instead of "hidden"
//    - It's not the default because Opera still does some funny things when you scroll.
//    - This can also result in an un-neaded non-functional scroll-bar becoming visible
//      when the page content *doesn't* extend past the height of the browser window.
//      You can cover that with a background on #{!container} for other browsers.

// You can override these variables either @import or when declaring a mixin
// !page-container should contain all of your page content
// !lightbox-container should be a sibling after !page-container
//  - must contain an unordered list, each item containing !lightbox classed divs
//  - each list item should also have it's own descriptive ID to link to
//  - the first list item should be empty with a !close-box ID
!page_container     ||= "#container"
!lightbox_container ||= "#lightboxes"
!lightbox           ||= ".box"
!close_box          ||= "#close"

// By default these lightboxes use an IE hack.
// You can turn that off here and use +lightbox-ie in your ie-specific stylesheet instead.
!lightbox_hacks ||= true

// import lightboxes
@import css-lightbox/lightbox.sass
